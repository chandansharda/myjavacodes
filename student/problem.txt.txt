Create an abstract class called Student. The Student class includes a name and a boolean value representing the full-time status. 

Include an abstract method to determine the tuition, with full-time students paying a flat fee of $2000 and part-time students paying $100 per credit hour. 

Create two subclasses called FullTimeStudent, PartTimeStudent. Create a console application that demonstrates how to create objects of both subclasses. Allow the user to choose student type and enter the number of credit hours.
